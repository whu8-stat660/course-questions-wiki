* Question (whu8-stat660): Compared with R or SQL, what’s the advantage of SAS in data analytics?
* Answer (whu8-stat660): R is the lingua franca of statistics. It is a free and open source programming language used to perform advanced data analysis tasks. Python is a multi-purpose, free and open source programming language which has become very popular in data science due to its active community and data mining libraries. SAS has been the undisputed market leader in the enterprise analytics space. It offers a huge array of statistical functions, has a good GUI for people to learn quickly and provides brilliant technical support.SAS is extremely efficient at sequential data access, and database access through SQL is well integrated.The drag-and-drop interface makes it easy for you to create better statistical models quickly. It has decent functional graphical capabilities in SAS.(*Reference*:https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/r-python-or-sas-which-one-should-you-learn-first)

[fizz_buzz Week 1 SAS Recipe]
* Question (yli110-stat660): What's the function of mod()?
* Answer (yli110-stat660): mod(a,b) returns the remainder of the division of a/b.
* Question (mphan12-stat660): Would “mod(i,15)=0” achieve the same results as “mod(i,3)=0 and mod(i,5)=0”?
* Answer (mphan12-stat660): Yes, “mod(i,15)=0” and “mod(i,3)=0 and mod(i,5)=0” are the same.
* Question (whu8-stat660):How would SAS process the if-then-else statement?
* Answer (whu8-stat660):First, SAS checks expression-1. What happens next depends on whether or not the condition in expression-1 is met. This is why IF-THEN-ELSE statements are sometimes referred to Conditional Processing.If expression-1 is true, SAS executes statement-1 and does NOT check the remaining ELSE IF statements. SAS will then continue to process any additional code following the block of IF-THEN-ELSE statements.If expression-1 is false, SAS will move to the next ELSE IF line and check expression-2.If expression-2 is true, SAS executes statement-2 and does NOT check the remaining ELSE IF statements. SAS will then continue to process any additional code following the block of IF-THEN-ELSE statements.If expression-2 is false, SAS will check the next ELSE IF expression. This last ELSE statement does not have an expression to check, so SAS will execute the THEN statement whenever this line is read. IF-THEN-ELSE statements are processed sequentially, so the only way SAS will execute the last THEN statement is if none of the previous IF and ELSE IF conditions have been met.(*Reference*:https://analytics.ncsu.edu/sesug/2013/CC-18.pdf)
